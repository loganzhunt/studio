// Ensure that the 'Atom' icon used in getDefaultDeepDive is imported and correctly wrapped if it's from lucide-react
// For example, if 'atom' is a key in your Icons object:
// const DefaultArchetypeIcon = Icons['atom'] || HelpCircle; // Or a generic fallback
// Or ensure Atom is wrapped:
// const WrappedAtom = IconWrapper(Atom);
// ... and then use WrappedAtom in getDefaultDeepDive
// For now, I'm assuming 'atom' as a string is a placeholder for an icon key
// which would be resolved by your FacetIcon component or similar logic.
// If 'atom' is meant to be a Lucide icon directly, it should be imported and wrapped:
// const DefaultArchetypeIcon = IconWrapper(Atom);
// And then used: icon: DefaultArchetypeIcon (if FacetIcon expects a component) or 'atom' (if FacetIcon expects a key)
// The FacetIcon component currently expects a facetName string, and looks up the icon from FACETS config.
// For archetypalPatterns, we are providing a keyof typeof Icons.
// So getDefaultDeepDive should also use a keyof typeof Icons.
// Let's use a generic icon key as a fallback.
const defaultArchetypeIconKey: keyof typeof Icons = "sparkles"; // Or any other generic key from your Icons

// Update: Re-checked how archetypalPatterns[].icon is used in facet/[facetName]/page.tsx.
// It expects a keyof typeof Icons. So the getDefaultDeepDive should be fine with string keys.
// The placeholder icons in the newly added content were: "brain", "zap", "heart", "bookOpen", "globe", "target".
// These need to ensure they are valid keys in the Icons object.
// I will update the placeholder icon assignments to be more robust or use a generic one if specific ones don't match.
// For simplicity now, I'll use the main facet icon key for its archetypes for now.
// For example, Epistemology archetypes would get 'brain' if 'brain' is a key in Icons.
// Let's correct the assigned icons for archetypalPatterns in the new data:
// Epistemology -> 'brain'
// Praxeology -> 'zap'
// Axiology -> 'heart'
// Mythology -> 'bookOpen'
// Cosmology -> 'globe'
// Teleology -> 'target'
// This assumes these strings are valid keys in your Icons object.
// If not, they will fall back to Icons.archetypes in the facet/[facetName]/page.tsx.
// Let's ensure the placeholder text for whatIf, strengths, tensions, blindspots are distinct and meaningful for each facet.
// I've already added placeholders during the mapping in the previous step, so this should be fine.
// The main task is integrating the large JSON block.
