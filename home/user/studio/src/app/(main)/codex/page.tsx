I can help with providing the code structure for that change. However, I need the *entire* content of the `/home/user/studio/src/app/(main)/builder/page.tsx` file to accurately perform the removal of the old import and replacement of the component usage.

Please provide the complete code for `/home/user/studio/src/app/(main)/builder/page.tsx`. Once you provide the full code, I will return the complete, modified code with the `TriangleChart` import replaced by `ClientTriangleChart` and the component usages updated.

**Please provide the full code for `/home/user/studio/src/app/(main)/builder/page.tsx`.**
