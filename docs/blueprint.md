# **App Name**: PrismFacet

## Core Features:

- Triangle Facets: Implement a triangle component with distinct facets (sections).
- Glassmorphism Styling: Apply a glassmorphism-style appearance to the facets, simulating a prism-like material.
- Facet Hover Animation: Animate a subtle refraction ripple or wave effect on a single facet of the triangle in response to the user hovering the mouse pointer (or keyboard focus). Apply the same hover over animation to all triangles on the website
- Visual Harmony: Blend the refraction animation smoothly with the existing glass styling. Ensure non-hovered facets remain static and clear.
- Brightness Shift: Briefly enhance the brightness/saturation of a facet when its animation runs, enhancing the simulation of refracted light. Non-animated sections maintain base level appearance.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to evoke ethereal light and subtle energy, reminiscent of twilight.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F5F5FF) with minimal saturation to provide a clean, airy backdrop that complements the refraction effects.
- Accent color: Pale yellow (#FFFFE0) to highlight the refraction animations.
- Clean and modern sans-serif font.
- Minimalist icons.
- Subtle, smooth transitions for hover effects.
- Maintain clear, uncluttered layout.
